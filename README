Turbo-CRL Readme
----------------

Turbo-CRL is a tool for fetching revocation lists for a given collection of
certificates (in openssl 'hashdir' format). Turbo-CRL is GPLv3 licensed, see
COPYING for details.

** This tool is provided with no warranty what-so-ever, implied or otherwise. **


Installation
------------

The installation should be fairly straight forward, on RHEL you need the
following packages installed, they can all be found in the base repos.

- openssl
- python

Just copy the turbo-crl.py to a suitable binary directory (like /usr/bin) or
build the spec file and install the RPM.


Usage
-----

You can run turbo-crl.py manually just by providing a certificate directory as
the only argument:

turbo-crl.py /etc/grid-security/certificates

It is also possible to run Turbo-CRL using cron, this should simply be a case
of copying the example turbo-crl.cron to /etc/cron.d, customising it as
necessary.

See "turbo-crl.py --help" (or just read the source) for a full list of options.


Bugs
----

There are certainly many bugs. Please send any bug reports to sf105@ic.ac.uk
with a subject starting "TCRL Bug", remembering to include as much detail as
possible.


Uninstallation
--------------

If for any reason you want to return to using other tools, you simply need to
remove all of the .r0 files and .r0 symlinks from your certificate directory.
This can be easily achieved by doing an "rm -f *.r0".
